# Array-in-C

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate various operations and concepts related to arrays. These programs were created during my first semester while learning about arrays and their applications in C programming.

## Contents

Here is the list of programs included in this repository:

1. **1_D_array.c** - Demonstrates basic operations on one-dimensional arrays.
2. **2_D_array.c** - Demonstrates basic operations on two-dimensional arrays.
3. **Array.c** - General implementation of arrays in C.
4. **Array_addition.c** - Adds two arrays element-wise.
5. **Bubble_sorting.c** - Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using arrays.
6. **Decimal_to_binary_using_array.c** - Converts a decimal number to binary using an array.
7. **Matrix_multiplication.c** - Performs multiplication of two matrices.
8. **Sum_diagonals.c** - Calculates the sum of the main and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.
9. **linear_search.c** - Implements the linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.

## Purpose

This repository is a compilation of programs that helped me understand:
- Basics of arrays (1D and 2D).
- Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.
- Matrix operations (addition and multiplication).
- Searching techniques (linear search).
- Problem-solving using arrays in C.
